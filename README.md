## Hi there 👋

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Toronto, minoring in Mechatronics.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
*Machine Learning*
- 🧠 [Pedestrian Attention Recognition](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Pedestrian-Attention-Recognition-Deep-Learning-Project)  
  Built a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify pedestrian attention from real-world images. Focused on CNN architecture, image preprocessing, and training pipeline optimization. Work was done as part of a design group for course work in APS360: Fundamentals of Deep Learning.

*Design*

- 🦾 [Cinematography Robot Arm](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Cinematography-Robot-Arm/tree/main)

  Designed and produced the CAD models for a robotic arm targeted at hobbyists to acheive repeatable programmable movements for camera shots. Work was done as part of a design group for course work in MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design I.
- 🚲 [Ghost Bike Vulnerable Road User Warning Design Project](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Ghost-Bike-Vulnerable-Road-User-Warning-Design-Project)

  Designed a solution to intersection violence at St.George and Bloor. Project uses memorial aspects, sound and visual cues to encourage vulnerable road users (pedestrians) to practice safer behaviours at intersections. Work was done as part of a design group for course work in APS112: Engineering Strategies and Practice II.

*Mechanical*

- 📟 [Raspberry Pi 5 Casing](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Raspberry-Pi-5-Casing/blob/main/README.md)

  Designed, produced the CAD models and 3D printed a casing to protect a Raspbery Pi 5 intended to be on the end effector of the robotic arm for the Robots for Space Exploration rover. Done as design team work for Robots for Space Exploration.
