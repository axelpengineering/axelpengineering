## Hi there 👋

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Toronto, minoring in Mechatronics. This portfolio outlines the steps that I have taken to reach my desired career path to work in the Robotics industry. Therefore, I have gathered many technical skills through projects showcased here, in the Machine Learning, Design, Mechanical, Electrical and Mechatronics fields.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
*Machine Learning*
- 🧠 [Pedestrian Attention Recognition:](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Pedestrian-Attention-Recognition-Deep-Learning-Project)  

  Built a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify pedestrian attention from real-world images. Focused on CNN architecture, image preprocessing, and training pipeline optimization. Work was done as part of a design group for course work in APS360: Fundamentals of Deep Learning.

*Design*

- 🦾 [Cinematography Robot Arm:](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Cinematography-Robot-Arm/tree/main)

  Designed and produced the CAD models for a robotic arm targeted at hobbyists to acheive repeatable programmable movements for camera shots. Work was done as part of a design group for course work in MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design I.
- 🚲 [Ghost Bike Vulnerable Road User Warning Design Project:](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Ghost-Bike-Vulnerable-Road-User-Warning-Design-Project)

  Designed a solution to intersection violence at St.George and Bloor. Project uses memorial aspects, sound and visual cues to encourage vulnerable road users (pedestrians) to practice safer behaviours at intersections. Work was done as part of a design group for course work in APS112: Engineering Strategies and Practice II.

*Mechanical*

- 📟 [Raspberry Pi 5 Casing:](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Raspberry-Pi-5-Casing/blob/main/README.md)

  Designed, produced the CAD models and 3D printed a casing to protect a Raspbery Pi 5 intended to be on the end effector of the robotic arm for the Robots for Space Exploration rover. Done as design team work for Robots for Space Exploration.

- ⚙️ [Planetary Gear Box:](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Planetary-Gear-Box-Group-Project)

  Designed as part of a team in MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design I, we aimed to create at 12:1 speed reduction gearbox 3D printed with a maximum of 6 hours of print time. We opted for the bonus marks by making the input and output shafts colinear.

*Mechatronics*

- 🖥️ [Motor Communication with CAN, ROS and Ubuntu:](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Motor-Communication-With-CAN-ROS-Ubuntu)

    Goal of implementing velocity control capabilities for a SparkMax motor for a robot arm in Robots for Space Exploration. Learned how CAN communication works, learned how to use the windows terminal, wsl, ubuntu and ROS 1 to acheive this. First determined PID values which enabled the motor to conntrol velocity. This enabled me to code in python to make use of ROS to control the motor velocity. Finally, learned how to implement my code into its own environmnet within the team's github repositories.

- ⚡️ [Joulemeter:](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Joulemeter-Project)

    Goal to create a joulemeter in conjuction with a few other group members. Process involved soldering, using breadboards and working with arduino IDE.
