## Hi there 👋

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Toronto, minoring in Mechatronics.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- 🧠 [Pedestrian Attention Recognition](https://github.com/axelpengineering/Pedestrian-Attention-Recognition-Deep-Learning-Project)  
  Built a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify pedestrian attention from real-world images. Focused on CNN architecture, image preprocessing, and training pipeline optimization.

- 🦾 Cinematography Robot Arm
  Designed and produced the CAD models for a robotic arm targeted at hobbyists to acheive repeatable programmable movements for camera shots.

- 📟 Raspberry Pi 5 Casing
  Designed, produced the CAD models and 3D printed a casing to protect a Raspbery Pi 5 intended to be on the end effector of the robotic arm for the Robots for Space Exploration rover.
